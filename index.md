# How to read this Book


```{admonition} Attention
:class: attention
This book is work in progress and subject to further changes.
```

This book aims to provide an interactive experience in providing the possibiliy to run a network simulation.

The first two chapters provide an introduction to why the topic is relevant as well as the methodological background used for this simulation. The following chapter offers the possibiliy to simulate with own specified parameters.

````{admonition} Hint
:class: hint
A klick on the Rocket symbol on the top right makes it possible to start an interactive coding session with "Live Code".
Another possibility is to choose "Binder" to open a remote jupyter session.

__Beware:__<br>
A limiting factor for too big simulations might be the limited available RAM and CPU for live-code and jupyter-sessions. One way to overcome this, is to download the GitHub Repository and run these notebooks on a local computer (provided jupyter and a suitable environment as given [in here](https://github.com/AndreGismo/SNEE-Projekt/blob/master/.binder/environment.yml)). The easiest way to accomplish this is by downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
