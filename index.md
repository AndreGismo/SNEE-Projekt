# How to read this Book


This book aims to provide an interactive experience in providing the possibiliy to run a network simulation.

The first two chapters provide an introductio to the topic as well as the methodological background used for this simulation. The following chapter offers the possibiliy to simulate with own specified parameters.

````{admonition} Hint
:class: hint
A klick on the Rocket symbol on the top right makes it possible to start an interactive coding session with "Live Code".
Another possibility is to choose "Binder" to open a remote jupyter session.

__Beware:__<br>
A limiting factor for these remote sessions as well as the interactive coding sessions is the limited available disc space as well as limited computational ressources. One way to overcome this, is to download the GitHub Repository and run these notebooks on a local computer (provided jupyter and a suitable environment as given [in here](https://github.com/AndreGismo/SNEE-Projekt/blob/master/kerber_timeseries_v04.py)). The easiest way to accomplish this is by downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
